The conclusion of this project:
In November 2011 there was a decrease in the number of customers (only 13% customers retain with us until 2 months). Marketing analysis or product analysts may be able to look back at what promotional strategies were used for customers in January 2011 (29% customers retain with us until 12 months), where the percent number of customers in that month was quite high and stable.
